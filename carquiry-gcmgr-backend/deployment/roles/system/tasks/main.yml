# Baseline apt config #
#######################

# This is a real pain. We need python-apt installed to get apt Ansible modules
# working. Except that the packages isn't always called python-apt, and you need
# to make sure the apt-cache is up to date or it might try to install an out of
# date package. This means we need to make sure we update the cache and install
# python-apt before doing anything with the apt Ansible module (which we would
# want to use for this exact purpose... why they can't implement apt-cache
# updates without this I do not know).
#
# So the end result is that to avoid having to update the cache *every* time we
# run, we make sure this works on the first run, and we'll skip it on all the
# rest. We do this by making the command touch a file when it finishes, which
# will then keep it from ever running again. (It's in temp, which means reboots
# will run this again, but that's not big concern)
